# Browser Dev Tools

When developing or debugging Pluto, it can be very useful to check the browser developer tools. This is how you do it:

## Step 1: [Check these instructions for opening the panel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools)

## Step 2: The JavaScript *Console*
Now that you have the panel open, you need to open the **Console** tab in this panel. It should look like this:

**To make sure you found it**, check for the message *"Pluto.jl, by..."*

If something goes wrong, you will probably see a **message in red**, which is not supposed to happen. Take a screenshot!
