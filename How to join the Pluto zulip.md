# How to join the Pluto zulip

The best way to get in touch with fellow Pluto users is to join our **zulip chat**. Zulip is a chatting website (similar to Slack), but it is free, which means that you can also read old messages.

We are a **subchannel of the Julia zulip**. To join it:
1. Click here to join the Julia zulip: [https://julialang.zulipchat.com/](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/)
2. Create an account, or log in with github/google.
3. After logging in, you need to **Add the Pluto stream** using this button:

That's it, see you there!
